# WasteClassificationCNN
This project designs a CNN model for plastic waste picture classification-a crucial step in recycling. Data set preparation, with labeling and augmentation, the training of the model using TensorFlow/PyTorch, evaluation for accuracy and reliability, and optional web interface or API deployment to all, fosters AI-driven sustainability.
